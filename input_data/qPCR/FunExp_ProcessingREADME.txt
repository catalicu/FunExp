FunEx1 - 9/10/2022, PL

There may be samples on the two weird plates from 3-04 and 3-24. 
It isn't clear what these belong to.
If something is missing, check those .eds files.

These are samples excluded entirely because all three reps looked bad.

There were duplicates of the following samples (on different plates).

I kept whichever one was on the most recent plate, under the assumption the qPCR was re-run for some reason.



This was really annoying to try to figure out without knowing what all the samples in the project are and why there were duplications.

I'm pretty sure 5-03 is a total redo of 4-15. The only sample name that is different on 4-15 is A07TAR1, but it might be a duplicate missing a number after TA (0 or 1). It was excluded.

FunEx1_calculations file only includes samples from 5-03 and 4-27. I excluded all data from 4-15.

Shapes of the melt curves was added to FunEx1_calulations, since there were a lot of weird shapes.
